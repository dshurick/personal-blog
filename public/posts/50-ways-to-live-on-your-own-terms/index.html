<h1 id="1-stop-depending-on-caffeine">1. Stop depending on caffeine</h1>

<pre><code>“Addictions embody repetition without progress. They produce incapacity as a payoff.” — Steven Pressfield
Although people think they perform better on caffeine, the truth is, they really don’t. Actually, we’ve become so dependent on caffeine that we use it to simply get back to our status-quo. When we’re off it, we underperform and become incapable.
</code></pre>

<p>Isn’t this absurd?</p>

<p>The problem isn’t the caffeine. It’s the compulsion and dependence. The need to rely on it to do everyday tasks which shouldn’t require it. Use it if it’s strategic, don’t abuse it to the point of ineffectiveness.</p>

<p>In his book, The Untethered Soul, Michael Singer argues that your energy should come from within — from your why — not from external stimulants. The scientific backing is substantial and unsurprising: intrinsic motivation destroys extrinsic motivation every day of the week.</p>

<p>Motivation aside — healthy eating, sleeping, and intensive exercise produce higher quantities and quality of energy than caffeine ever could. A holistic approach to life is essential. Garbage in, garbage out.</p>

<h1 id="2-pray-or-meditate-morning-mid-day-and-night">2. Pray or meditate morning, mid-day, and night</h1>

<p>In a recent interview at the Genius Network mastermind event, Joe Polish asked Tony Robbins what he does to get focused. “Do you meditate? What do you do?” Joe asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I meditate. I don’t know that I want to meditate and think about nothing,” Tony responded, “My goal is clarity.”</p>

<p>Instead of full-on meditation, Tony has a morning routine that includes several breathing exercises and visualization techniques that get him to a state of clarity and focus. For me, I use prayer and pondering (my version of meditation) as the same vehicle.</p>

<p>Whatever your approach, the goal should be clarity and focus. What do you want to be about today?</p>

<p>What few things matter most during the next 24 hours?</p>

<p>I’ve gotten the best results as:</p>

<p>My morning prayer and meditation are motivational
My afternoon prayer and meditation are evaluative and strategic
My evening prayer and meditation are evaluative and reflective</p>
